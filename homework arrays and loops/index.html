<!-- Arrays Homework

  Submitting a text entry box

 

    You have to create an array that will hold 5 different kinds of fruit.

    Output to the console
    Create a FOR loop that will output all elements of this array, one by one in the console

Prompt the user for one number (N) and calculate the factorial (N!).
explanation: the factorial of a number N is calculated by this formula N! = N * (N-1) * (N-2) * ... * 2 * 1
for N = 5 the factorial is N! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 -->
